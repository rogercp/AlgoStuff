// We have an array of integers, where:

// The integers are in the range 1..n1..n
// The array has a length of n+1n+1
// It follows that our array has at least one integer which appears at least twice. 
// But it may have several duplicates, and each duplicate may appear more than twice.

// Write a method which finds an integer that appears more than once in our array. 
// Don't modify the input! (If there are multiple duplicates, you only need to find one of them.)

// We're going to run this method on our new, super-hip MacBook Pro With Retina Displayâ„¢. 
// Thing is, the damn thing came with the RAM soldered right to the motherboard, 
// so we can't upgrade our RAM. So we need to optimize for space!
