// # getting their food first. Yikesâ€”that's not good for business!

// # To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the registers with my laptop and recorded:

// # The take-out orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (take_out_orders)
// # The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (dine_in_orders)
