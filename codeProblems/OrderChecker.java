// My cake shop is so popular, I'm adding some tables and hiring wait staff so folks can have a cute sit-down cake-eating experience.

// I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other folks eating inside the cafe. All the customer orders get 
// combined into one list for the kitchen, where they should be handled first-come, first-served.

// Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who placed orders after them are getting their food first. Yikesâ€”that's not good for 
// business!

// To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the registers with my laptop and recorded:

// The take-out orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (takeOutOrders)
// The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (dineInOrders)
// Each customer order (from either register) as it was finished by the kitchen. (servedOrders)
